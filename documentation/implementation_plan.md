6.  Setup Push Notifications UI and Configuration:

    *   Action: Implement notification registration and handling in `AppDelegate.swift` (or equivalent SwiftUI life‑cycle method) to allow push notifications for reminders.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4 (Push Notifications).

7.  Develop Magical UI Elements:

    *   Action: Create custom components such as `MagicAnimation.swift` in `/GenieList/Components/` that deliver fun animations (e.g., confetti effect upon task completion) and integrate glassmorphic UI.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 1 & Design Preferences.

8.  **Validation:**

    *   Action: Build and run the app in the Xcode Simulator; verify that all UI screens load correctly with smooth transitions and that animations perform as expected.

**Phase 3: Backend Development**

1.  Configure Supabase Database Schema:

    *   Action: In the Supabase dashboard, create tables for `users`, `tasks`, `notes`, `events`, and `templates` (for the template marketplace).
    *   Reference: PRD Section 2; Tech Stack (Supabase).

2.  Implement Authentication Module:

    *   Action: Develop `AuthManager.swift` in `/GenieList/Services/` using Supabase Auth to handle user account creation, email/password login, and session management.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 2 (User Accounts); Q&A (User Account Management).

3.  Implement Data Models and Sync:

    *   Action: Create model files (e.g., `Task.swift`, `Note.swift`, `Event.swift`) in `/GenieList/Models/` and integrate Supabase API calls in a data manager (e.g., `DataManager.swift` in `/GenieList/Services/`).
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4 (Core Data Features).

4.  Configure Cloud Backup and Auto-Sync:

    *   Action: Ensure that Supabase real‑time syncing is enabled and document scheduled daily backup procedures. Create a documentation file at `/GenieList/Docs/Supabase_Backup_Guide.md` detailing backup intervals and sync on change.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4 (Cloud Backup & Automatic Sync); Q&A (Cloud Backup).

5.  **Validation:**

    *   Action: Write and run unit tests in `/GenieList/Tests/SupabaseTests.swift` to verify authentication flow and data synchronization with Supabase.

**Phase 4: Integration**

1.  Integrate Supabase with Frontend:

    *   Action: Wire up `AuthManager` and `DataManager` in SwiftUI views to perform CRUD operations from the app.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 3 & 4.

2.  Configure Push Notifications End‑to‑End:

    *   Action: Connect the notification registration logic with Supabase-driven events and test with simulated push notifications on device.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4.

3.  Integrate Optional AI Suggestions:

    *   Action: Develop `AISuggestionManager.swift` in `/GenieList/Services/` capable of querying GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for productivity tips. This module should be integrated within the dedicated "Genie" tab.
    *   Reference: Q&A (AI Suggestions); PRD Section 4 (Optional AI Suggestions).

4.  Integrate Collaboration and Template Marketplace Features:

    *   Action: For real‑time collaboration, implement sharing functionality by creating a share link/invitation mechanism in `CollaborationManager.swift` located in `/GenieList/Services/`. Similarly, set up a marketplace view in `MarketplaceView.swift` under `/GenieList/Views/` for templates.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4 (Real-Time Collaboration & Template Marketplace).

5.  **Validation:**

    *   Action: Test user flows by signing in, creating tasks/notes, sending dummy push notifications, triggering AI suggestions, and inviting collaborators. Verify data is synced in real‑time.

**Phase 5: Deployment**

1.  Prepare for TestFlight Deployment:

    *   Action: Configure deployment settings in Xcode (bundle ID, version numbers, signing identities) and generate an IPA for TestFlight submission via App Store Connect.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 6; Tech Stack (Xcode).

2.  Create and include Privacy Policy & Compliance Documentation:

    *   Action: Draft a privacy policy document detailing GDPR, CCPA, and Apple App Store guidelines compliance. Save as `/GenieList/Docs/Privacy_Policy.pdf` and integrate into the app’s onboarding documentation.

3.  **Validation:**

    *   Action: Submit the beta to TestFlight and perform end‑to‑end testing with internal users to ensure smooth deployment and adherence to privacy standards.

**Phase 6: Post-Launch**

1.  Setup Analytics and Monitoring:

    *   Action: Integrate a suitable analytics tool (if desired) and monitor app performance and crash reports through TestFlight feedback or built‑in logging. Document within `/GenieList/Docs/Monitoring_Guide.md`.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 7 (Non-Functional Requirements: Monitoring).

2.  Schedule Routine Data Backup Checks:

    *   Action: Review and monitor Supabase backups and auto‑sync schedules; update `/GenieList/Docs/Supabase_Backup_Guide.md` as needed.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4 (Cloud Backup & Automatic Sync).

3.  Plan Regular App Updates and User Feedback Integration:

    *   Action: Establish a cycle for collecting user feedback (via TestFlight or in‑app prompts) and schedule iterative updates to improve performance, UI animations, and bug fixes.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 7 (Scalability and Maintenance).

4.  **Validation:**

    *   Action: Conduct simulated user load tests and monitor backup logs; verify system stability and data integrity across devices with real user actions.
